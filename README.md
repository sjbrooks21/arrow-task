# arrow-task
repo for arrow task rotation project with the CCN Lab (2023)

For a full description of the codes, refer to the **Full Code Documentation** file in the docs folder

**Arrows Task**: A hierarchical task in which the high level rule changes probabilistically throughout a session.

Code in this repo runs simulations of the task using different types of models:
- Bayes
- Reinforcement Learning
- Win-Stay-Lose-Shift
- Lazy Arrow

Model parameters and features of the task are adjusted to see how this alters task performance.
Comparisons are made between model types, as well as within model types with differing parameters
